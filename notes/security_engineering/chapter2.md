## Chapter 2:

* Security Requirements:
  - It is very important to know what to secure, against whom and to what extent
  - Functional requirements descrive what the systems are supposed to do
(Goal and IO)
  - Non Functional : Security, Usability...

* Usage of attack Trees:
  - Nodes are the threats
  - The top most node is the "Goal". 
  - Have to be refined as much as possible
  - Ideally we have to identify all the possible ways of attack through this. 
  - Could also compute the probability of the attack at each node
  - at each node we can also show the type of equipment needed or the cost of that particular attack. So target the nodes with non specialized equipment and the cheapest node.
 
* Functional Safety and Information Security

  - Probability of a Security breach cannot always be predicted.

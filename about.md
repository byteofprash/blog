I'm Prashanth, born and brought up in India, currently living in beautiful Augsburg, Germany. 
Finished my Master's from the Technical University of Munich with focus on Machine learning in Computer Vision.
Current focus on how deep learning has impacted the field of Medical Imaging, and how the SOTA DL algorithms can be taken in to everyday clinical practice. 

So Prashanth is a tech guy? Not entirely. Apart from tech, I love to travel, read, take pictures and build things. 
I love to build furniture, and read a lot about history and philosophy. I try a lot of personal experiments, like stop reading news, going on a mouna sadhana. A long time follower of Gandhi and gandhian values, and recently striving to know more about Vivekananda and Aurobindo.

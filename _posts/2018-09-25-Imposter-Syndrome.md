## Let's talk about Imposter Syndrome 

In the sea of links that are shared in my group chat, @Vichu shared a link. [Link](https://medium.com/@realkniels/lets-talk-about-imposter-syndrome-7e3314c8c730)
A quick skim through the article and everything that I read checked off. 

* Sudden loss of confidence - ✓
* Comparing yourself to others - ✓
* Worrying about how you are perceived - ✓
* Undermining your own achievements - ✓
* Uncharacteristic levels of perfectionism - ?
* Crippling fear of failure - ✓
* Discounting or not internalising praise - ✓
* Procrastinating when you usually gravitate to action - ✓ ✓

When I start to introspect when these thoughts started to cripple inside me, it was after moving to Germany!

But how do I know these feelings are because of my syndrome or of something that I actually fail to do?

### Let's talk about Imposter Syndrome among culture swappers
#### Hypothesis 1: The white man's burden:
Growing up in India, white man's burden is common place. Probably it was a 300 year old colonial hangover, but it was very much present. As a culture, Indians look up to the west, in validation of thier own achievements, in validation of anything superior or authentic. A culture where anything from the west is superior and approved by foreigners' is a mark of trust. Why? Probably the colonial hangover. 

This is something which sticks with you for longer. Though you constantly try to reaffirm the utter stupidity of this, 20 years of this stigma is quite difficult to remove.
